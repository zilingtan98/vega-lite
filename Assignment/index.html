              </h2>
              <p id="txtContent">
                There are a few factors that could determine the cost of a wine, such as
                type of grapes used, wine origin region, taxation, winemaking process, and labor cost.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Port/Sherry wines generally are more expensive </strong>than other types of wines, as
                it is stored longer and fortified. It costs a lot of money to keep the product in 
                a shed for several years before it is blended and bottled. Also, because of the higher alcohol content, 
                typically 20% ABV, which attracts a higher level of taxation.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, <strong>Rosé wines are cheaper</strong> to make, spends almost no time in the cellar, and is released early.
                Rosé wine's cost of production is among the lowest of all categories of wine.
